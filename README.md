## Description

We are creating a Web App called "What the Fridge!" for University of Calgary students to help find recipes based on the student's ingredients. This would result in students expanding their recipe options when they lack ingredients. Our web app will also allow users to post their recipes and leave ratings and reviews on others. We can create a community through the recipes our app can share with this. Users will be able to tell if a recipe is worth their time or not with the help of the ratings. Also, commenting can allow users to share any customizations to recipes they prefer. Cooking can be tedious, especially when individuals do not know what to make. With the help of What the Fridge, students will no longer need to ask, "What should I make?"

#### Technologies

- Front end - Bootstrap, CSS, HTML, JavaScript.
- Backend - NodeJs, ExpressJs, MongoDB Atlas(Cloud Database),
